        "For the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals exam, I chose to work on the **Pokémon VGC AI competition project**, specifically pursuing the **Battle Policy track**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The implemented battle policy interacts with a predefined environment—a highly convenient framework [1]—that manages the game state and its updates, allowing the user to focus solely on policy development.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**The goal of the policy is to defeat any other battle policy, regardless of the team composition used.**  \n",
        "\n",
        "The game of Pokémon is particularly interesting. When considering teams of three Pokémon, the branching factor for each player's possible states is at most **6** (four attack moves and two switches). Both players select their moves simultaneously, and the new game state is then evaluated.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple factors to take into account:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. An agent may encounter issues such as infinite looping, continuously selecting the `switch` action.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. In the short term (i.e., looking one turn ahead), we can make a reasonable estimation of the new state, but in the long term, this estimation loses significance due to several factors:  \n",
        "  a. The game incorporates **probability**, introducing randomness into outcomes.  \n",
        "  b. During the initial phases, the game is **not fully observable**, meaning we might complete a battle without ever having full knowledge of the opponent’s team.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For these reasons, I decided to implement a **Monte Carlo Tree Search based Battle Policy**. My goal was to leverage the robustness of MCTS, complemented by heuristics to guide the playouts and the node selection effectively.  "

        "Additionally, the implementation of Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search has been proposed by **Ihara H., et al. (2018)** [3] to address the imperfect information scenarios inherent in Pokémon battles, aiming to mitigate strategy fusion issues caused by determinization.  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Moreover, the integration of deep reinforcement learning and neuroevolution has been investigated by **Rodriguez, G., et al. (2024)** [5] to enhance AI performance in the VGC context, highlighting the adaptability of these methods to the game's dynamic environment."

Integrating heuristics significantly boosted its effectiveness by guiding MCTS to prune suboptimal moves and focus on more promising strategies.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This refinement not only improved efficiency but also reduced unnecessary or ineffective actions.  \n",

        "Additionally, the inherent randomness in MCTS contributed to the robustness of the policy, enabling it to adapt to the stochastic nature of Pokémon battles.  \n",
        "\n",
        "By combining strategic pruning through heuristics with randomized exploration, the approach achieved a well-balanced capability to handle uncertainty and imperfect information.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This project greatly enhanced my understanding of game AI, decision-making under uncertainty, and heuristic-driven search methods. There is still substantial room for improvement, and I am particularly interested to explore the integration of reinforcement learning, as its potential deeply intrigues me.  "
